### ➕ Project Overview
> This project aims to analyze if a text contains words considered inappropriate and allows the addition/deletion of new words to the list of unwanted words or exceptions.

### 💻 Technical Solution
> A TypeScript and Node API was created that accesses Web-purify services and, through HTTP methods, supports the frontend to analyze user inputs, as well as manage the words that will be considered. The visual part of the project > was made in React and with the Typescript template for CRA.
